## FAQs and Issues

### How do I downgrade?
If you are on mobile or console, there's unfortunately no reliable way to downgrade.

On Windows, you can use [MrARM's MCLauncher](https://github.com/MCMrARM/mc-w10-version-launcher/releases/tag/0.4.0) to downgrade to pretty much any version (including 1.12)!

### I'm stuck on locating server and/or I can't join the server!
You have most likely not done a Loopback Exempt for your PC (This prevents your PC from joining connections started from it. Refer to [this article from PMMP](https://doc.pmmp.io/en/rtfd/faq/connecting/win10localhostcantconnect.html) to learn how to fix that. __Remember to run the Loopback Exempt Fix as __Administator__ in Powershell.__
