### I'm stuck on locating server and/or I can't join the server!
  There are probably either two things that are occuring:
  
1. You are attempting to join a Dragonfly server (i.e Vasar)
2. You have not done a Loopback Exempt for your PC (This prevents your PC from joining connections started from it. Refer to [here](https://doc.pmmp.io/en/rtfd/faq/connecting/win10localhostcantconnect.html) to learn how to fix that. __Remember to run the Loopback Exempt Fix as __Administator__ in Powershell.__
